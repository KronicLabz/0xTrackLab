# 0xTrackLab
Designed for web3 recording artist, have the ability to have all your web3 NFT/Music work including single tracks and full albums, on one contract, your forever contract. 

Forked from 
https://github.com/mcgingras/standard-audio-contracts.git

The goal is to convert the ERC721 format to an ERC1155 to be able to release each album as its on contract "Subtape" and each tack on that album released as editions for the traditional style NFT music mint.
